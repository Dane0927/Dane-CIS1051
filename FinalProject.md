My origional project for this was supposed to be a remixed version of pong with a more advanced ai system and power-ups. 
I struggled with the making of the project, unable to figure out how to make the power-ups work properly. I then switched 
my project over to a themed version of Atari Breakout. The project is beach themed, where a man hits a beach ball up into 
the sky to get rid of the seagulls. It features a point system along side a three life system where at the end of your three 
lives you lose the game and must restart. As you play the game, the more seagulls you knock away the faster the beach ball 
will move making the game increasingly harder. I also added in looping background noises along with game sound effects to 
make the game more emersive and entertaining. I came across a few difficulties that made the project moer difficut than I 
anticipated. The first one was trying to keep the image quality high while still fitting everything onto the screen proportionally.
I was able to make some improvements to my origional design, however it is still not as clear as I would like. Another difficulty 
I came across was lining up the games hit boxes with the images I chose. The images are not perfect squares or rectanges and the 
gameplay seemed slightly off. I made the game perform more accurate but I believe that there is still room for improvement. 
I really enjoyed the process of the project because I have always enjoyed games and seeing a finished project I created myself 
is very fulfilling no matter how simple or easy the game may seem. Below is the URL to my youtube video with voiceover demoing 
the complete game.
