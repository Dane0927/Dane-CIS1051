# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Advanced Pong

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I would like to remake the game pong to be more advanced and more difficult than the origional game. This would include more features to make the game more interesting and fun than before.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My Advanced Pong game will incorperate features that will allow the player to travel in the X direction as well as the Y direction. 
I can easily do this by altering my code to allow the rectangle paddle to move in the X direction just like it can in the Y
The game will also include power-ups that the player can collect that can possibly do either of the following (larger paddle, slower ball, multiball, X and Y travel ability etc.)
I will do this by coding randomly generated powerups throught the map the player can pick up or I will change the players abilities based on what "level" or score they are currently on.
I also want to change the colors of the game to make it more interesting as well as some of the sound effects and text. 
I can change these from the origional code and I can download differnt sound and text files.
Another change I would make to my origional project is to update the ai to make the game more challanging while also playable and fun. 
The game is currently too hard and the ai player will always win no matter what and that should be changed.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish the majority of features I posted above. I believe that making the paddles go in different directions, the colors, sounds, and text will be fairly easy.
I am expecting the power-ups to be more time consuming and difficult with more of a learing curve.  

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can accomplish a remixed game of pong including all the power-ups and more but I know this will have more of a learning curve to me to be able to figure that out.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to be able to generate a user friendly ai that can challange the player with a variety of difficulties while still being possible to beat it. 
I do not whaat the player recieving the same level of ai skill every round because that can be too easy and predictable.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to aquire skills that will allow me to randomly generate items on the current field that the players can pick up to use. 
I will also need to learn and research a more advanced ai method than what i am currently using. I believe I already have the skills to change the look of the game to make it more interesting and engaging.
I also believe that the change in direction for the paddles will be easy and not very difficult to incorperate.
I think it will be most hard to learn how to add and pickup the power-ups while also teaching the ai to utilize them as well.
