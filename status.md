Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have made minor changes to the code I previously had to alter the movement of the paddles and slight improvements to the opponent ai. I am not as far as I would like to be at this point. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not completed any of the theme changes or added the power-ups to the game yet.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have not encountered any problems yet because I have only completed the easy tasks so far.
